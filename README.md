# 🍕 Credit Crust  
*A game about building credit, one slice at a time.*

Credit Crust is a financial-literacy game designed for kids and teens that teaches how **credit cards, credit limits, and credit scores** work — without penalties, stress, or real-world consequences.

Players learn that **using credit responsibly doesn’t mean avoiding it**, but **paying it back**.

## 🎯 Game Goal

Make a pizza.

That’s it.

But to do that, the player must learn how to:
- use a credit card wisely
- respect a credit limit
- pay off credit to increase their score
- unlock better opportunities over time

When the pizza is complete, the player reaches a **perfect credit score of 900**.

No scores ever go down. Only progress.

## 🧠 Learning Objective (Why This Matters)

Many kids and teens hear that “credit is bad” — without ever learning *how* it actually works.

Credit Crust teaches that:
- credit is a **tool**, not a punishment
- paying credit increases trust and opportunity
- higher credit unlocks better options
- progress comes from responsible decisions, not fear

This aligns directly with the **Financial Literacy & Empowerment** challenge.

## 🔁 Core Game Loop

1. Play a mini-game → earn coins  
2. Use coins → pay off credit card balance  
3. Paying credit increases:
   - credit score
   - credit card limit  
4. Use credit → buy pizza ingredients  
5. Repeat until pizza is complete 🍕

## 💳 Credit System (Clear & Friendly)

### Starting Values (Example)

- **Credit Score:** 100  
- **Credit Limit:** 200  
- **Wallet:** 0 coins  
- **Credit Balance:** 0  

---

### Paying Credit (The Most Important Rule)

Every time the player pays credit:

- **Credit Score +100**
- **Credit Limit +50**
- **Credit Balance decreases**

Buying items **does not** increase score.  
**Paying credit does.**

There are **no penalties**, no interest, and no failure states — only learning through forward movement.

## 🛒 Grocery Store (Credit-Only Purchases)

The grocery store teaches a critical rule:

❌ Coins cannot be used  
✅ Only credit cards (up to the limit)

Some ingredients are **locked** until the player’s credit limit is high enough.

### Example Ingredients

| Ingredient | Credit Cost | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Dough | 100 | Always available |
| Sauce | 150 | Moderate limit |
| Cheese | 200 | Higher limit |
| Toppings | 300 | Advanced limit |

To unlock better ingredients, players must **pay credit first**, not grind endlessly.

## 🤖 Gemini AI: The “Inner Voice”

Credit Crust uses **Google Gemini** to power an in-game **Inner Voice** that reacts dynamically to player actions.

### What Gemini Does

- Generates short, witty bubble-text responses
- Reacts to player decisions in real time
- Reinforces good financial habits
- Makes learning feel personal and fun

### Examples

- Paying credit → celebrates score & limit growth  
- Earning coins → suggests paying off debt  
- Buying ingredients → comments on pizza progress  

All responses:
- are **1 sentence**
- use **pizza puns**
- are encouraging, never shaming

### Why This Matters

The Inner Voice:
- replaces dry instructions with personality
- helps kids reflect on decisions naturally
- reinforces learning without lectures
- makes financial literacy feel human
